# Python = High-level General Purpose Scripting Language
# Areas of programming = GUI programming, Web programming, Database programming, Network programming
# Game development, Multithreaded programming, Mobile Applications, ML/AI, Data Science
# Hybrid language (Compiler based + Interpreter based)
# Compiler = The entire source code is translated only at once into the machine code and then executed by the machine.
# Interpreter = Each source code is translated line-by-line and then executed by the machine simultaneously.
# Python uses hybrid compiler to translate the source code first into byte code and then into the machine code and then execute it.
# Python executes on PVM (Python Virtual Machine)

## Features of Python
# Simple/Expressive, Easy to learn, Open source, Platform independent,
# Portable (lightweight), Dynamically typed, extensible, embeddable, huge library, scalable

# py - Windows specific launcher (find and run python installed)
# python - Actual interpreter executable (finds python.exe via PATH )
# conda - environment/package manager (Anaconda) (Not a Python, creates isolated environments with their own python/libraries)

## Interpreters
# Python 3
# This is the standard, official Python implementation.
# Written in C
# (py → CPython 3.14.2)

# PyPy 3
# An alternative Python implementation
# Uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation
# Often faster for loops & heavy computation

# Commands 
# py -m pip install <package>
# py -m pip show IPython
# py -m IPython

# \n = New line
# \" = if u want to print a quotation mark
# ''' or """ = Triple quotations for multi-line
a = 23
b = 54
c = a + b
print('Sum is ', c)
print('hello world')
print('Urvashi Urvashi take it easy,Urvashiiii.... Mashallah')

d = int(input("Price = "))
if (d > 200):
    print("Eligible")
else:
    print("Not Eligible")
